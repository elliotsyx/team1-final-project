### Motivation:

Some facts about shooting incidents worldwide NYU student case  
many schools → students Also tourists → employees  
choosing NYC

### The goal of our project:

·Understanding risk factors for shooting incidents in NYC

·Visualizing the distribution of shooting outcomes in New York City

·Predict the time series for the future shooting incidents in boroughs
of NYC

### The intended final products:

Using data and graphs to find out the potential factors and correlations
such as payroll, and unemployment rate that lead to the high shooting
accident rate in the boroughs of NYC and predicts the incidents rate in
the future years.

### The planned analyses/visualizations/coding challenges:

·various plots, such as boxplots, scatter plots, and pie charts with
analysis

·a visual map shows the incidents in different boroughs across NYC

·coding challenge: Using time series to conduct the prediction of
Incident Rate( decompose

### The planned Timeline

11.8 - group meeting

11.10 - construct proposal

11.13-17 - group meeting with TA and make changes to our proposal

11.17 - group meeting – discuss details of the project, clean the raw
data, and assign each part to the group member

11.20-12.1 - every group member finish their parts individually and
combine the whole materials together to make a roughly basic project

12.4-12.8 - group meeting – creating a polished HTML webpage involves
careful design, responsive layout, and attention to detail; using screen
recording software to create a screencast demonstrating the interaction
with our website
